## Terms & Conditions

Rewards are purposive incentives with an aim to help writers build visuals for their story. If you participate, you acknowledge that they prize money will be used towards paying illustrators, editors, letterers, and other parties involved in the process of making your visuals.

For example: first place prize ($3,500) winner is obliged to build a full fledged comic, including comic pages with lettering, cover image(s), and optionally promotional art (concept art, banners etc.). Number of comic pages should be a subjectively sufficient amount, but we estimate that this budget will help build 10-25 full pages.

Other prize ($500) winners are obliged to build concept art and/or cover art, excluding comic pages.

-----
dReader team will help winners build the visuals and/or flesh out the story if the winner requests for help.

dReader reserves the rights to reject or make amendments to the proposed budget by the winner. 

In other words, if the winner proposes an invoice from an illustrator which charges $1000 per illustration we might politely refuse the invoice and propose an illustrator from our network which can work with the relevant prize budget.

The winner of the first prize agrees that the comic series will be published on dReader (at least as an off-chain comic). This grant does not imply that dReader will take any ownership over the IP which the writer produces.

The main goal of this grant is to provide writers with enough resources to build out comics they've written, or at least help make concept art.
